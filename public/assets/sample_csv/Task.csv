Online Writing,Benefits of Online Writing,1,1,"Benefits of Online Teaching and Learning
Why online distance learning and why now? Online distance learning meets the needs of an
ever-growing population of students who cannot or prefer not to participate in traditional
classroom settings. These learners include those unable to attend traditional classes, who
cannot find a particular class at their chosen institution, who live in remote locations, who work
full-time and can only study at or after work, and those who simply prefer to learn independently.
The minimum requirement for students to participate in an online course is access to a
computer, the Internet, and the motivation to succeed in a non-traditional classroom. Online
courses provide an excellent method of course delivery unbound by time or location allowing for
accessibility to instruction at anytime from anywhere. Learners find the online environment a
convenient way to fit education into their busy lives. The ability to access a course from any
computer with Internet access, 24 hours a day, seven days a week is a tremendous incentive
for many of today?s students

Some of the main advantages of online learning include: 

Convenience: 24/7 access from any online computer; accommodates busy schedules; ",300
